    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 1:</strong> Place the Guajillo and Ancho chiles
      in a bowl full of near-boiling water. Allow the peppers to soak for at
      least 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 2:</strong> While the peppers soak, season the
      chuck roast chunks with salt and pepper to taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 3:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large
      Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. In 2 batches, sear the roast on all
      sides, using more oil as needed. Transfer the seared chuck roast to a
      plate and set aside.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 4:</strong> Add the remaining oil, tomatoes,
      onion, and garlic to the pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 5:</strong> Pour in the beef broth to deglaze
      the pot.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 6:</strong> Transfer the hydrated chiles from
      the bowl of water to the pot. Add the short ribs, spices, and cinnamon
      stick. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and maintain a gentle
      simmer for 30 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 7:</strong> Remove the short ribs and add to the
      plate with the seared roast. Skim the top of the pot to remove any
      impurities from the bone cooking out. Remove the cinnamon stick and
      discard. Transfer about 1 ½ – 2 cups
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 8:</strong> Use an immersion blender to blend
      the remaining pepper and tomato mixture until smooth.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 9:</strong> Return the short ribs, seared beef,
      and any juices back to the Dutch oven. Add the orange juice, apple cider
      vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce heat
      to medium-low, and cook for at least 3-4 hours
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 10:</strong> When the beef is cooked through,
      remove the short rib bones. Shred the meat with 2 forks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 11:</strong> Remove the reserved braising liquid
      from the refrigerator. Working 1 tortilla at a time, dip the tortilla in
      the reserved liquid. Place the tortilla on a large skillet set over medium
      heat.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 12:</strong> Top half of the tortilla with 1-2
      tablespoons of shredded cheese, 2-3 tablespoons of shredded beef, and a
      sprinkle of onion and cilantro. Fold the tortilla in half to close.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 13:</strong> Top half of the tortilla with 1-2
      tablespoons of shredded cheese, 2-3 tablespoons of shredded beef, and a
      sprinkle of onion and cilantro. Fold the tortilla in half to close.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 14:</strong> Cook the tacos for 30-45 seconds on
      each side until crisp. Transfer to a serving platter and squeeze fresh
      lime juice over the top.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong class="Step">Step 15:</strong> Repeat with the remaining tortillas
      and serve with any remaining braising liquid on the side for dipping.
